Please, please come in and listen to what I have to say.%SPEECH_OFF%You cautiously walk into the room and take a seat, glancing momentarily to make sure nobody was hiding behind the crook of the door or behind one of the bookshelves lining the walls. %employer% pushes a map across his table.%SPEECH_ON%See those green markings? Those are greenskin movements, tracked by my scouts. Sometimes they tell me by word, sometimes they don\'t tell me at all. Those scouts just... poof, disappear. It doesn\'t take a genius to know what really happened to them though, does it?%SPEECH_OFF%You ask what the man wants. He slams the map, his fist landing square on %townname%.%SPEECH_ON%Can you not see? They\'re coming this way and I need you to help defend us!%SPEECH_OFF% | %employer%\'s nervously picking his nails when you find him. He\'s got them down to nubs by this point, just flecks of skin and blood shaving away at this point.%SPEECH_ON%Thank you for coming, warrior.

My scouts keep disappearing and the folk that keep arriving aren\'t exactly the most accurate of witnesses to depend upon.

Just calm down!%SPEECH_OFF%Someone throws an onion, battering the man upside the head with a tearjerking rap of sour vegetable.

When you sneak in, he simply plops down in his chair and pours you a drink.%SPEECH_ON%Greenskins are coming and I don\'t believe there are enough men on hand to defend %townname%. Obviously, I\'m willing to call on and pay for your services to help keep %townname% safe from this green menace.%SPEECH_OFF% | A man is standing outside %employer%\'s abode, two painted slabs of wood dressed over himself. On each board is written some prophetic doomsayer\'s tale. You ignore the man and enter the house. %employer% is standing there, laughing and shaking his head.%SPEECH_ON%That guy standing out there ain\'t wrong. My scouts have been reporting greenskins moving through the area for a while. I should have listened for how my scouts haven\'t said anything for a good week, presumably because those very same greenskins got their hands on them. Now I got the commonfolk coming to me with horror stories of what is going on out there, and how a large horde of those awful creatures are coming this way.%SPEECH_OFF%He turns to you, grinning, madness spinning in his grin.%SPEECH_ON%So what say you and I broker a deal and shut up that doomsayer\'s shrill crying?

I suppose I can\'t fault that.%SPEECH_OFF%He fans an arm out to a few clansmen standing nearby. They have crates of goods with them, stuffed belongings that range from moldy vegetables to a chicken or two, or maybe those two chickens are one just tiny and squawky lamb.%SPEECH_ON%Those people would like to you to stay and help. But I understand why you wouldn\'t. I was there at the Battle of Many Names. I know what it\'s like to fight those beasts. I won\'t fault you. It takes a man of great measure to take them on. So it is, so it is, yessir, and I won\'t fault ya, not one bit.%SPEECH_OFF%He slowly hobbles away and it is then that you notice that one of his legs is replaced by a wooden peg. A few children run to him and he speaks with the group of clansmen. He looks back at you, then back to them, and shakes his head.
